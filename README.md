## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

All my git repositories are hosted over on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/chaoticenginerd) and my Github account is mostly for collaborating and reporting issues.

I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without our permission. I do not consent to GitHubâ€™s use of my code in Copilot.
